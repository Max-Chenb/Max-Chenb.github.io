<img src="https://max-chenb.github.io/BiaoChen.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Biao Chen (陈彪)**.

I am a Ph.D. student in **Mechanical Engineering** at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I am extremely fortunate to work with my advisor, [Prof. Xun Huan](https://uq.engin.umich.edu/people/xun-huan/), the leader of [UQ-SciML Group](https://uq.engin.umich.edu/).

## Research Interests

My current research focuses on **Explainable AI**, while my previous research focused on Industrial Surface Defect Detection Based on Machine Learning. My interests are on the **Machine Learning** and its applications in **Industrial Field**. I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
